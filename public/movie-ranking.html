<h3><b><p>#1 True Romance (1993) </p></b></h3>
<p>Based on a script written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott, 1993's "True Romance" is a blast of fun and entertainment with a very lively story centered around Clarence Worley, an Elvis Presely-obsessed comic book nerd whose deep love for movies lead to him encountering a woman named Alabama in a theater on his birthday and after one night of passion they decide to get married. However, things take a crazy turn when the two lovers end up stealing a suitcase worth of cocaine that belongs to a drug lord named Blue Lou Boyle and they flee to L.A. in order to sell it off for $200,000 as various mobsters come after them and what you get is a sweet romance tale wrapped into an insane story with some great characters, all things that a fun film should have in it. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette as Clarence and Alabama give us two extremely likable characters whose romance from the jump is cute and believable as we see two flawed but pure souls come together and look to start a new life away from the grimy streets of Detroit, and you root for them to sell the drugs and get the money needed to start fresh. Supporting characters such as Dennis Hopper's Clifford Worley, a security guard and father to Clarence, Christopher Walken's villainous Vincenzo Coccotti, Gary Oldman's dreadlock insane pimp Drexl, Michael Rapaport's struggling actor Dick Ritchie, and Brad Pitt's stoner Floyd all make for larger than life performances that range from terrifying to comedic, while James Gandolfini, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, and and Val Kilmer as Elvis aka Clarence's conscience have small but memorable moments in the film amongst a stacked cast. The combination of an authentic romance, a crime story surrounding a suitcase of cocaine, and even the subplot of producers in Hollywood bragging about movies they've made and the various film references see Tarantino pen a script highlighting his love for film within a wacky story that makes for a fun time of a watch, and easily Scott's best directed film. It also makes me hungry for a hamburger the number of times Clarence eats one in this damn movie.</p>
<h3><p>#2 Clerks (1994) </p></h3>
<p>'Clerks' is... not great in a lot of ways if you're approaching it for the first time in our modern times (I'm writing this review in 2023). But for kids in the 90's (like myself) the mythology of how this movie came to be combined with dialog that understood youth culture at the time in a film that got a widespread release was inspiring.
    The best way that I can describe the way we saw this film as teens/young adults in the 90's was as if an ordinary person you went to high school with had somehow broken a seemingly impossible glass ceiling in entertainment and was able to tell their own story with all the crude jokes and anecdotes that all of us normal peers could relate to at the time.
    While not all of us got to actually know this person (Kevin Smith) in real life (including myself), I think a lot of us were proud to see someone who understood us and our world succeed in a industry that seemed closed off to us regular people.
    With this explanation out of the way (and why I rated this -at best- 3 star film as a 4), like I said at the beginning, this film (that I can reenact jokes/lines from perfectly) has many, many problems.
    It's doesn't flow and is structured in story/joke chunks (probably to hide Smith's film inexperience at the time). And while the acting can feel believable at times (especially the relationship and conversations between Dante & Randal), it can also -very much- feel like you're watching an amateur stage performance with actors clearly stumbling in reciting their lines.
    Add all that with a comedy that is clearly stuck with nearly unbarred humor from the 90's and it's easy to see how a large modern audience seeing this for the first time could be confused about how this (and Kevin Smith) got the fandom it has.
    If it wasn't for the nostalgia that I get when I revisit this film, the knowledge of what happens with a lot of these characters later, and that this film created the foundation of one of my favorite films (Clerks 2); I'd probably be in the same I-don't-get-it camp as a new modern audience would be in today (especially knowing about who produced this film). 
    But this film is a visual representation of my teenage years and where I was at the time so I still have a special place in my heart for it</p>
<h3><p>#3 The Crow (1994)</p></h3>
<P>A masterpiece that is overshadowed by the tragedy that befell lead actor Brandon Lee. The Crow is a cinematic triumph, not only would I conclude it to be the best comic book film of all but it's simply one of the best movies ever created. The Crow excels in every artistic endeavor, the movie is funny, moving, filled with epic action segments it also has one of the most visually striking settings in any feature. The cinematography is breathtaking, the visuals are superb, the entire film holds up very well to the point of being ageless. 

    Brandon Lee may have never got to see the final product but he knew it would be a major leap forward in his all too short career. His layered performance reminds us of the terrible loss that fatal day cast upon the film world. Lee was destined to portray Eric Draven, he was also it would seem destined to die in his greatest role, reality and fiction blurred eerily during the Crow's difficult production. What was perhaps more heartbreaking was it nearly didn't get completed until director Alex Pryos and the dedicated team of crew members agreed to finish the movie, it was the an important way to honor the hardship and sacrifice that Brandon made. A stunt double was used for the final unfilmed scenes. 
    
    It may be Brandon Lee's movie but the rest of the great cast more than hold their own  Michael Wincott especially gives us one of the most enjoyable bad guys as big bad Top Dollar. 
    The Crow still feels undervalued, the tragedy remains discussed but the brilliance of the final product is underestimated. 
    Pryos would make the equally superb Dark City which has also been swept under the film rug in later years two of among the best movies of the 90s were two that strangely were left behind. 
    The Crow deserves to be watched again reminding young audiences how much the film world benefited from it's creation, and most significantly to keep Brandon Lee's spirit with us.</P>
