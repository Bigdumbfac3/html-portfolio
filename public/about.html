<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello World! thats how everyone starts there web development career right? </p>

<p>firstly, im Johnny. * BIGDUMBFACE_* Im an autisic with touch of ADD, which explans why i find computers easier to deal with than people.
Ive always an intrest in coding, back in the day building custom myspace profiles for friends.. ( ahh the good old days of social media, tom truely was just wanting to be our friend)
I put off learning code for far too long, so here i start. this page will change as i develop better skills or maybe you wont see it at all if i give up and find a thread on the floor more appealing to play with.. 
</p>

<p>The end result of al lof this really is a career change, to get out of Retail, to somewhere more comfortable like my computer chair, to work remotly for a company or take advantage of a digital nomad visa and move to spain with my best friend, 
  Maybe get a city appartment & job near to them .</p>
